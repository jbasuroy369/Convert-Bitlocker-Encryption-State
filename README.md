# Convert-Bitlocker-Encryption-State
The script in here helps you to convert your existing managed devices in 128bit used-space only encrypted state to 256-bit full encryption state.
You can achieve the same by manually running the Bitlocker.ps1 script on the device, or from Intune as a Remediation package using the Detection and Remediation script provided.
